This refinement increases the number of parameters needed to define the final laminate. Thus, a suitable optimization process for the parameters that describe the variable angle tow (VAT) and the number of layers must be implemented so that the mass is minimal for a given load case. The optimization process must further consider the viability of the chosen parameters imposed by the hardware restrictions of AFP and the physical properties of the carbon fiber material so that the produced laminate is free of defects.",
